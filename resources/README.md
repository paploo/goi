The main source of kanji data for jisho.org, among others. The only real problem is that the JLPT levels no longer 
work:

> The (former) Japanese Language Proficiency test level for this kanji.
Values range from 1 (most advanced) to 4 (most elementary). This field
does not appear for kanji that were not required for any JLPT level.
Note that the JLPT test levels changed in 2010, with a new 5-level
system (N1 to N5) being introduced. No official kanji lists are
available for the new levels. The new levels are regarded as
being similar to the old levels except that the old level 2 is
now divided between N2 and N3.
