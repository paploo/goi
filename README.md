**Vocabulary**


## Overview

Tooling around the 日本語 I have been learning, such as:
- Database for holding all the vocabulary I know.
- Tools for exporting to Anki flashcards.

## Technology

Technology wise, it is mishmash of tooling that swaps between
* Getting things done quickly using tooling I am proficient in, and
* Trying out new-to-me technologies because I enjoy learning things.

This will inevitably make the code base a mess; maybe one day I'll refactor it
away with something better.
