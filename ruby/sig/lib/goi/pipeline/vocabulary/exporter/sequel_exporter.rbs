        # We currently use a na√Øve method based on the google sheet being the source of truth:
        # 1. Delete all vocabulary
        # 2. Reload all, emitting an error for any that doen't load.
        # This is really slow, loading about 100 vocabs/sec on my machine.
        #
        # One strategy to make this faster is to record a deep checksum for each vocabulary,
        # and then update the ones that have changed (and, as long as the google sheet is
        # the source of truth, delete any vocab that no longer exists).
